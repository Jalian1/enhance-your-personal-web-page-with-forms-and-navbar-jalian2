<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey! I'm Jalian Yarborough, a student-athlete at Erskine College majoring in Information Technology. Originally from Newberry College, I love football, gaming, and working out. Welcome to my personal space where I share a bit about myself!</p>

<h3>Favorite Hobby: Football and Video Games</h3>
<p>Football allows me to push my limits, while video games offer a fun escape during my downtime. Both help me stay balanced, focused, and give me moments of relaxation away from the daily grind.</p>


<p>"Strive for progress, not perfection!"</p>
